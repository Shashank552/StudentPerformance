## End to End machine learning project

This ML project is going to prediction a student math_score from the other several features.
When you try to run this project in your browser:
first you need to run app.py,
And then open a local host page(e.g: 127.0.0.1:5000), it would say: "Welcome to the Student Performance Prediction"
finally if you want to see the project working, you need to redirect the home page to 127.0.0.1:5000/predictdata
and then enter the required fields and you are good to go.
